          <p>Immediately after the development of my first game, Nation Rising, I decided I wanted to create a library of game functions so that I would have to deal with less low-level graphics code upon beginning my next project. I also was interested in learning more about how game engines worked and thought that creating my own would afford me an opportunity to delve more deeply into the code behind games that I admired. My first attempt was a failed project called the Sigma engine that I halted development on after a year because the project had become too bloated and buggy. Resolving to do it properly the next time, I began to research how game engines worked, and about a year later began development on what I called the VIPER engine. The current form of the engine is a 2D game engine that also contains swing-compatible elements and integrates my earlier work with cryptography into a separate package. I have used this in many of my other projects - some published, some not - as a custom library that makes it possible for me to quickly develop games and also to simplify the display process in other types of applications. I'm extremely proud of the result, and intend to extend it further in the future.</p>

            <a id="Shooter" class="anchor" href="#Shooter" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Yet untitled Galaga-type game</h3>
          <p>Though the package name is currently "Galaga", I intend to take this app a lot further (and to eventually change the name so I don't get sued). During the summer of 2016, I was one of the instructors in my high school's annual App Development Camp. I helped my group of six kids aged 11-16 learn the Swift programming language and develop their first game. The Galaga app started during that time as a way to demonstrate the kind of end result that the kids should be shooting for, and to help me brush up on my Swift programming skills before the camp. It is currently a clone of the famous Galaga shooter for iOS, and my plan for it is to develop it into my own Danmaku-type scrolling shooter game. However, I need to get access to a Mac first - the only thing halting me from continuing development on the app is the fact that I no longer have access to my high school workstation. I will also upload a screenshot of the app at this time - I don't have access to a Mac with which I can compile and run the app, and am thus unable to provide a visual currently.</p>
