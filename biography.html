<a id="Education" class="anchor" href="#Education" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Education</h3>

          <p>I attended high school at a small boarding school in Asheville called "The Asheville School". I am currently a first-year student at Georgia Tech in the College of Computing, and am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I've chosen Intelligence and Systems and Architecture as my concentrations.</p>

          <h3>
            <a id="Interests" class="anchor" href="#Interests" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Interests</h3>

          <p>Professionally, I am interested in software development and how that software interacts with the various types of hardware that it will be run on. Specifically, I'm very interested in the future of artificial intelligence and in the limitations of current neural nets. I'm also intrigued by cryptography and by algorithms in general, and have implemented and optimized several particularly interesting cryptographic algorithms myself. In my spare time, I enjoy reading and am involved heavily in music. I play guitar and piano, and have been recently learning to use digital music production software. I also enjoy writing, and am flirting with the idea of launching a blog.</p>
<h3>
  <a id="Skills" class="anchor" href="#Skills" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Skills</h3>
          <p>I am proficient in the Java, Swift, and Python programming languages, and have taught classes on both Java and Swift. I speak Japanese at an intermediate level and Spanish at a basic level. I consider myself very capable with computer hardware and am familiar with networking, although I'm probably not to be trusted with a soldering iron.
<h3>
  <a id="Involvement" class="anchor" href="#Involvement" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Involvement</h3>
          <p>My first formal programming work was with the University of Southern California's MediaQ project. Among many other projects, I developed encryption software for server communications in both Java and Python, the code for which is available <a href="https://github.com/YellowLineSoftworks/VIPER-Engine/tree/master/src/crypto">on GitHub</a>.</p>
          <p>I also recently worked with my local Helpmate domestic violence shelter to develop a security protocol document and an antimalware software detector and installer package for Windows. This project will help the organization avoid an enormous fee they were previously paying to a local company to perform antimalware operations individually for each incoming victim's electronics. This project is not yet available online, but I intend to change that as soon as I coordinate with the developer I worked with to produce a Macintosh-compatible version of the software and documentation.</p>
          <h3>
            <a id="Future Goals" class="anchor" href="#FutureGoals" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Future Goals</h3>
          <p>I intend to become a more experienced software developer with a wider scope of completed projects over the next few years. I want to branch into more fields, such as iOS app design with the goal of eventually releasing something onto the App Store and potentially Android development. More personally, I'm aiming to become a proficient digital audio producer and also to become fluent in the Japanese language.
